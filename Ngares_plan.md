# Ngare's Plan: SEO-First Revenue Opportunities and Forecast

## Assumptions
- Timeframe: Month 1 = next month from kick-off, through December (8 months total).
- Traffic today is minimal; paid budget stays low ($100–$300/mo) and focused on validation.
- Monetization is lead-driven: warm introductions to auditors/buyers with rev-share/CPL; no productized SaaS yet.
- Close rates improve as intent pages rank and ops speed-to-lead tightens (≤5 minutes for high intent).
- All projections are directional; adjust monthly with real funnel data.

## Core Assets
- Auditor Directory (11 city pages) + Auditor Matching flow.
- SOC 2 cost/readiness/timeline calculators and industry/stack pSEO pages.
- Vendor risk / pentest / ISO 42001 (AI) pages for secondary intent.

## Revenue Models (stackable)
- **Rev-share / success fee**: % of closed audit deals referred (target $1.5k–$3k per closed deal).
- **CPL**: Flat fee per qualified intro (target $200–$400 CPL once quality proven).
- **Sponsored placement**: Featured auditor slots in directory (monthly/quarterly; $500–$2k/slot once traffic justifies).
- **Content syndication**: Paid inclusions in cost/timeline guides (light touch; $250–$500/post once ranking).
- **Future SaaS/benchmarking** (optional): Readiness index/API access; not assumed in projections.

## Channels
- **SEO/pSEO**: City auditor pages; SOC 2 cost/timeline/industry/stack pages; comparison pages.
- **Targeted paid search**: Exact/phrase on “soc 2 cost/auditor” for validation and to smooth seasonality.
- **Communities / outbound**: Manual LinkedIn + founder/CTO communities to backfill early demand.
- **Email nurture**: Existing day0/day3/day7 sequences; add fast-path for VIP leads.

## Month-by-Month (conservative, organic-first)
- **Month 1**: Publish all city pages (done), tighten lead routing, add CTA to auditor directory in nav (done). Traffic 0.5–1k visits, 1–2 qualified leads/mo. Revenue: $0–$500 (pilot intros).
- **Month 2**: First rankings for long-tail city queries; start CPL pilots with 1–2 auditors. Traffic 1–2k, 4–6 qualified leads. Revenue: $500–$1.5k.
- **Month 3**: More cost/industry pages indexed; begin sponsored placement conversations. Traffic 2–3k, 6–10 leads. Revenue: $1.5k–$3k (mix rev-share/CPL).
- **Month 4**: Stabilize top cities (SF, NYC, LA, Seattle); add featured slots. Traffic 3–5k, 10–14 leads. Revenue: $3k–$6k.
- **Month 5**: Broaden cities/industries that show impressions; raise CPL for proven segments. Traffic 4–6k, 12–18 leads. Revenue: $5k–$8k.
- **Month 6**: Sponsored placements live; higher rev-share volume. Traffic 5–7k, 14–20 leads. Revenue: $7k–$11k.
- **Month 7**: Defend rankings (internal links, FAQs, schema); small paid test to smooth demand. Traffic 6–8k, 16–22 leads. Revenue: $8k–$13k.
- **Month 8 (December)**: Seasonal bump from year-end SOC 2 urgency; maximize speed-to-lead. Traffic 7–10k, 18–26 leads. Revenue: $10k–$16k.

## Projections (mid-case, monthly run-rate by December)
- **Leads/mo (qualified)**: ~22
- **Close rate to paid intro**: 40–50% (CPL or rev-share accepted)
- **Rev/share per closed deal**: $2k mid-case
- **CPL per accepted intro**: $300 mid-case
- **Blended monthly revenue**: ~$12k (half CPL, half rev-share)
- **MRR (if normalized)**: ~$10k–$12k by December
- **ARR (run-rate)**: ~$120k–$140k

### Low/High Bands (December run-rate)
- **Low**: $6k/mo (ARR ~$72k) — slower SEO uptake, lower close rates.
- **High**: $20k/mo (ARR ~$240k) — stronger rankings + higher CPL/rev-share.

## Passive Potential
- **Semi-passive** once rankings + responder SLA + handoff scripts are stable (expect 4–6 months). Still need light ops for lead vetting and buyer relations monthly.

## Exit / Valuation (if productized lead-gen)
- Lead-gen multiples are typically **1.5–3.0x annual earnings**. On a $120k–$240k ARR-equivalent, indicative exit could be **$180k–$720k**. Higher multiples (3–5x) require durable traffic, documented playbooks, and diversified buyer contracts.

## Focus to Hit Mid-Case
- Defend and internally link all city pages; add FAQs/schema.
- Speed-to-lead: <5 minutes for VIP (audit ≤6mo, >20 FTE).
- Prove quality with 2–3 anchor auditors; set CPL + rev-share terms.
- Add 1–2 featured placements once sessions sustain >5k/mo.
- Monthly review: adjust projections with real CTR/lead/close data.
