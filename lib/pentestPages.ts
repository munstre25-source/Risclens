      { question: 'When should we scan vs pentest?', answer: 'Use scans continuously for hygiene; schedule pentests for major releases, compliance needs, and customer asks.' },
      { question: 'Do pentests include retests?', answer: 'They should. Budget retests to verify fixes; scans alone rarely satisfy that need.' },
      { question: 'Can we automate everything?', answer: 'Automation accelerates discovery, but context, chaining, and exploitation require human expertise.' },

      { question: 'How are retests documented?', answer: 'Reports should show retest status, evidence, and date so stakeholders know what changed.' },
      { question: 'Do reports include methodology?', answer: 'Yes—documenting scope, tools, and approaches builds credibility for auditors and customers.' },

      { question: 'Do we need a pentest for SOC 2?', answer: 'While not always mandated, most auditors and enterprise customers expect a recent pentest with remediation and retest evidence.' },

      { question: 'Does a pentest replace controls?', answer: 'No. Pentests validate controls but do not replace access, logging, or change management requirements.' },
