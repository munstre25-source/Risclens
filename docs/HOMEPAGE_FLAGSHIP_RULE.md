# Homepage Flagship Rule

## Purpose
The homepage’s sole job is to route serious buyers into the SOC 2 Readiness Calculator.

## Hierarchy
1. **Primary Action**: The SOC 2 Readiness Calculator ("Get your readiness score"). This is the only dominant, button-style CTA in the hero section.
2. **Secondary Actions**: All other actions (e.g., checklist download) are secondary and must not compete visually or cognitively. They should be demoted to text links or tertiary styles.

## Enforcement
- Future homepage changes must preserve this hierarchy.
- No other CTA may visually compete with the flagship readiness score CTA in terms of size, color, or weight.
- Framing must emphasize readiness as the first step before choosing tools or auditors.
