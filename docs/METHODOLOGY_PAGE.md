# RiscLens Methodology & Assumptions

## 1. Purpose of RiscLens Tools
RiscLens provides directional planning tools for B2B compliance buyers. Our goal is to reduce the "information asymmetry" between auditors and companies by providing data-driven estimates of readiness, cost, and timeline.

**RiscLens is NOT:**
- A CPA firm or licensed auditor.
- A guarantee of SOC 2 certification or "passing" an audit.
- A replacement for a formal readiness assessment performed by a qualified professional.
- Legal advice.

## 2. Scoring Methodology
Our Readiness Score (0-100) uses a **risk-based weighting model**:
- **Baseline Controls**: Core security practices (MFA, encryption, access reviews) form the foundation.
- **Risk Multipliers**: Factors like handling ePHI, financial data, or large employee counts increase the "bar" for readiness.
- **Auditor Expectations**: Weights are tuned based on common AICPA Trust Service Criteria (TSC) interpretations.

## 3. Cost Estimation Logic
Cost estimates are calculated as a range based on:
- **Auditor Fees**: Estimated based on company size and technical complexity (typically $15k–$50k).
- **Tooling**: Estimated costs for GRC/Automation platforms (typically $5k–$30k/year).
- **Internal Effort**: An estimated "man-hour" cost based on the engineering and operational effort required to remediate identified gaps.

## 4. Assumptions & Variability
Estimates are directional. Actual costs and timelines will vary based on:
- **Auditor Choice**: Tier 1 vs. Boutique firms have different fee structures.
- **Scope Specifics**: Number of cloud accounts, production systems, and employees.
- **Remediation Speed**: How fast your team can implement required controls.
- **System Description**: The complexity of your specific product architecture.

## 6. Editorial Policy & Content Integrity
To ensure the highest level of Trustworthiness (EEAT), RiscLens follows a strict editorial protocol:
- **Expert Review**: Every technical guide, pricing breakdown, and industry checklist is reviewed by a subject matter expert (SME). Current reviewers include CPAs, CISSPs, and Privacy Attorneys.
- **Independence**: RiscLens is not a vendor and does not accept payment for "Top Tool" rankings. Recommendations are based on deterministic data and auditor feedback.
- **Fact-Checking**: Data points (especially pricing) are verified through a combination of public records, anonymized buyer feedback, and direct vendor inquiries.
- **Correction Policy**: We perform quarterly audits of our entire pSEO catalog to ensure regulatory updates (e.g., changes to ISO 42001 or SOC 2 TSC) are reflected immediately.

## 7. Author Expertise (EEAT Signals)
We explicitly link our content to the following professional identities to establish Authoritativeness:
- **Raphael N. (CPA, CISA)**: Expert in SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria and financial controls.
- **Sarah L. (JD, CIPP/E)**: Expert in global privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and legal compliance.
- **Kevin A. (CISSP)**: Expert in cloud infrastructure security and technical remediation.
