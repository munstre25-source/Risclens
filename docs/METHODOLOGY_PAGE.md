# RiscLens Methodology & Assumptions

## 1. Purpose of RiscLens Tools
RiscLens provides directional planning tools for B2B compliance buyers. Our goal is to reduce the "information asymmetry" between auditors and companies by providing data-driven estimates of readiness, cost, and timeline.

**RiscLens is NOT:**
- A CPA firm or licensed auditor.
- A guarantee of SOC 2 certification or "passing" an audit.
- A replacement for a formal readiness assessment performed by a qualified professional.
- Legal advice.

## 2. Scoring Methodology
Our Readiness Score (0-100) uses a **risk-based weighting model**:
- **Baseline Controls**: Core security practices (MFA, encryption, access reviews) form the foundation.
- **Risk Multipliers**: Factors like handling ePHI, financial data, or large employee counts increase the "bar" for readiness.
- **Auditor Expectations**: Weights are tuned based on common AICPA Trust Service Criteria (TSC) interpretations.

## 3. Cost Estimation Logic
Cost estimates are calculated as a range based on:
- **Auditor Fees**: Estimated based on company size and technical complexity (typically $15k–$50k).
- **Tooling**: Estimated costs for GRC/Automation platforms (typically $5k–$30k/year).
- **Internal Effort**: An estimated "man-hour" cost based on the engineering and operational effort required to remediate identified gaps.

## 4. Assumptions & Variability
Estimates are directional. Actual costs and timelines will vary based on:
- **Auditor Choice**: Tier 1 vs. Boutique firms have different fee structures.
- **Scope Specifics**: Number of cloud accounts, production systems, and employees.
- **Remediation Speed**: How fast your team can implement required controls.
- **System Description**: The complexity of your specific product architecture.

## 5. Interpreting Results
- **Pre-audit (0-40)**: Focus on fundamental policies and technical baselines.
- **Early-stage (41-70)**: Implement repeatable controls and start evidence collection.
- **Near-ready (71-85)**: Fine-tune scope and perform a dry run.
- **Audit-ready (86-100)**: Formalize engagement with a CPA auditor.
