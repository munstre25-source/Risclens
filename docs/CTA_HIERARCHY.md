# RiscLens CTA Hierarchy Law

This document defines the strict, enforceable CTA hierarchy for RiscLens. All pages must adhere to these rules to prevent positioning drift, funnel confusion, and buyer-intent dilution.

## THE HIERARCHY

### TIER 1 — FLAGSHIP ENTRY
**Purpose:** Establish readiness reality.  
**Example CTAs:**
- Get your readiness score
- Start readiness assessment  

**Rules:**
- Only ONE Tier 1 CTA per page.
- When present, Tier 1 visually dominates.
- Homepage and SOC 2 pages default to Tier 1.
- No other CTA may compete with Tier 1.

---

### TIER 2 — DECISION SUPPORT
**Purpose:** Cost, timeline, ROI clarity.  
**Example CTAs:**
- Calculate compliance ROI
- Estimate SOC 2 cost
- Plan audit timeline  

**Rules:**
- May never visually compete with Tier 1.
- Secondary buttons or cards only.
- Allowed only after buyer intent is established.

---

### TIER 3 — EXECUTION
**Purpose:** Scoping and doing.  
**Example CTAs:**
- Scope your pentest
- Generate pentest SOW
- Tier your vendors
- Complete VRA questionnaire  

**Rules:**
- Assumes commitment already exists.
- Must never appear in homepage hero.
- Allowed only on hubs or downstream execution pages.

---

### TIER 4 — HUMAN / MONETIZATION
**Purpose:** Confidence + revenue.  
**Example CTAs:**
- Get a sanity check
- Request auditor intro
- Confirm this with an expert  

**Rules:**
- Never primary.
- Never aggressive.
- Appears only after results, ROI, or execution context.
- Must be framed as technical confirmation, not sales.

## ENFORCEMENT RULE

> **"No page may feature CTAs from more than TWO tiers. Tier 1 always outranks all others."**

## BUYER-INTENT DOCTRINE
1. **No "Learn" framing:** We do not educate for the sake of education. We provide tools to unblock deals.
2. **Readiness first:** All tools must be framed as a step toward or a validation of readiness.
3. **Action over information:** Every section must lead to a decision or execution step.
