# GLOSSARY

- **SOC 2**: Security audit framework covering Trust Service Criteria (Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, Privacy).
- **Type I / Type II**: Point-in-time design vs multi-month operating effectiveness assessment.
- **Readiness**: Pre-audit preparedness; RiscLens outputs a 0–100 readiness score + band (Early-stage / Near-ready / Audit-ready).
- **Cost Range**: Estimated auditor + tooling + internal effort band from deterministic scoring.
- **Timeline Band**: Estimated months to audit window based on inputs.
- **Evidence**: Artifacts proving controls exist/operate (policies, tickets, logs).
- **Controls**: Technical/process safeguards required to meet SOC 2.
- **Pentest**: Time-boxed security assessment simulating real attacks (web, API, mobile, cloud).
- **Vendor Risk Assessment (VRA)**: Process to evaluate third-party risk; includes tiering, evidence, and monitoring cadence.
- **CTA (Call to Action)**: Primary action per page; enforced as one dominant CTA in heroes.
- **RLS (Row Level Security)**: Database policy restricting row access by role.
- **Service Role**: Supabase privileged key bypassing RLS; server-only.
