| Page Path | Current Hero Headline | Score (0-10) | Notes | Proposed Replacement |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------------|-------|----------------------|
| `/` | Get a SOC 2 readiness score in 2 minutes | 8 | Good, but "early-stage companies" subhead is a bit generic. | **Headline:** Get a SOC 2 readiness score to unblock enterprise deals.<br>**Subhead:** Audit-ready gaps and cost estimates for high-growth B2B teams. |
| `/soc-2` | SOC 2 Compliance Hub | 6 | A bit generic. "Everything you need to plan..." is okay but lacks urgency. | **Headline:** SOC 2 Planning & Readiness Hub<br>**Subhead:** Estimate costs, identify gaps, and accelerate your path to audit-ready status. |
| `/penetration-testing` | SOC 2 Pentest Hub | 7 | Good focus on "auditors accept". | **Headline:** SOC 2 Pentest Planning Hub<br>**Subhead:** Scope and estimate penetration tests that unblock enterprise sales and satisfy auditors. |
| `/vendor-risk-assessment` | Vendor Risk Overview | 5 | Very generic. | **Headline:** Scale Your Vendor Risk Program<br>**Subhead:** Implement auditor-safe vendor tiering and review cycles to reduce third-party risk and save time. |
| `/compare/[slug]` | [Tool A] vs [Tool B] | 7 | Good for SEO, but the "Verdict" can be more buyer-intent focused. | **Notes:** Ensure the primary CTA is specific to the comparison (e.g., "See how [Tool A] fits your budget"). |
| `/soc-2-readiness-calculator` | SOC 2 Readiness Score in Under 2 Minutes | 8 | Strong. | **Subhead:** Identify potential gaps and get directional cost estimates to plan your compliance roadmap. |

## General Recommendations
- Shift from "Learn" to "Decide/Estimate/Compare".
- Use phrases like "Unblock revenue", "Audit-ready", "Enterprise-grade", "Risk-based".
- Replace "Understanding SOC 2" with "Strategizing Your SOC 2 Roadmap".
