# PPC Monetization Plan: $1,200/Lead Strategy

This document outlines how to monetize Risclens immediately using Pay-Per-Click (PPC) traffic and the built-in AI Copilot tech, bypassing the 6-month SEO wait time.

## 1. The Strategy: Arbitrage via Intelligence
The goal is to buy "expensive" traffic (Google Ads) and convert it into "Premium Leads" that auditors buy for $1,000 - $1,200.

*   **PPC Spend:** ~$50/day targeting high-intent keywords (e.g., "SOC 2 Readiness Audit", "ISO 42001 Consultant").
*   **The Problem:** Standard landing pages convert at ~1%. A $20 click becomes a $2,000 lead acquisition cost.
*   **The Solution:** The AI Copilot.

## 2. Technical Engine: Pay-Per-Conversation
The system is built to maximize the value of every single visitor through `app/api/copilot/chat/route.ts`.

### The "Turn 3" Pattern Interrupt
*   **Rule:** At the 3rd chat interaction, the AI is programmed to pause and offer a **15-page Custom Readiness Report**.
*   **Action:** This forces email capture at the moment of highest engagement.
*   **Impact:** Increases conversion rates from 1% to **3-5%**, making $20 clicks profitable.

### Lead Enrichment (The $1,200 Jump)
Standard leads (Name/Email) sell for ~$250. By using the AI to extract:
1.  **Industry** (e.g., Fintech, Healthcare)
2.  **Employee Count**
3.  **Timeline** (e.g., "Need audit in 3 months")
The lead is sold as "Market Intelligence" for **$1,200+** because the auditor knows exactly how to close the deal before they even call.

## 3. Implementation Steps
To start making money today without SEO:

1.  **Enable AI Chat:** Uncomment `ComplianceCopilot` in `app/layout.tsx`.
2.  **Set Budget:** Allocate $50-100/day for Google Ads targeting specific compliance frameworks.
3.  **Monitor Turn 3:** Verify the Lead Magnet trigger is firing in the chat logs to ensure no visitor leaves without an offer.

## 4. Expected Math & ROI Cycle
*   **Ad Spend:** $1,500/mo ($50/day)
*   **Clicks:** ~75 clicks at $20/avg
*   **Leads (4% Conv):** 3 High-Value Leads
*   **Gross Revenue:** $3,600 (3 leads x $1,200)
*   **Monthly Profit:** **$2,100** 

### Why the $50/day Recurring Spend?
The math above assumes a continuous "faucet." While the first investments "pay off" (e.g., your first $500 spent likely yields your first $1,200 lead), you keep the $50/day running because:
1.  **Arbitrage:** For every $1 you give Google, the system returns ~$2.40. Stopping the spend means stopping the profit.
2.  **Cash Flow Recycling:** After your first lead sale ($1,200), the business is self-funding. You aren't "losing" $1,500; you are reinvesting a portion of your profits to keep the lead pipeline full.
3.  **Bridge to SEO:** Once SEO kicks in (6-12 months), your "Cost Per Click" goes to $0. At that point, your profit jumps from $2,100 to $3,600+ because the $1,500 ad spend is no longer required to get those same 3 leads.

**Key Insight:** PPC is a *trading* strategy (Buy low, Sell high), while SEO is a *real estate* strategy (Build value, No rent). You use PPC to generate the cash flow required to fund the SEO build-out.
