# OPUS PLAN: The RiscLens Monetization & Growth Blueprint

## Executive Summary: The Intelligence Layer
If this were my project, I would not compete on "Software Features." I would compete on **Data Accuracy and Speed-to-Trust.** RiscLens isn't a tool; it's a filter that separates "curious browsers" from "ready-to-buy prospects." I would position the site as the "Switzerland of Compliance"—the only objective voice in a market full of biased vendors.

## Scenario 1: The "Sniper" Strategy ($50 - $100 Budget)
**Objective:** Capture 2–5 high-intent leads to prove the "Intelligence Premium" to buyers.

### The Steps:
1.  **Extreme Negative Keyword Lists:** I would block all general terms like "What is SOC 2." I want zero "education" traffic. I would add "free," "careers," "jobs," and "template" to the negative list immediately.
2.  **Long-Tail Intent Bidding:** I would only bid on "Bottom of Funnel" terms: "SOC 2 cost for fintech," "SOC 2 auditor NYC," or "Drata vs Vanta pricing."
3.  **The "Pre-Scoping" Chat Hook:** The ad would lead directly to a specific calculator page. The chat engine must ask: "How many employees?", "AWS or GCP?", and "Do you have a hard deadline?" 
4.  **Manual Enrichment:** For these 5 leads, I would manually find the CEO’s LinkedIn and the company’s latest funding round before sending the lead to a buyer.

### The "Why":
*   **Why the narrow focus?** At $20/click, $100 only buys 5 clicks. You cannot afford "learning." You need "certainty."
*   **Why manual enrichment?** If I only have 5 leads, I need to sell them for $500–$1,200 each. Raw data isn't worth that. A "Prepared Intelligence Brief" is. This proves the model to your first 2 buyers.

## Scenario 2: The "Machine" Strategy ($500 Budget)
**Objective:** Build a predictable lead-gen engine with a 3x-5x Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).

### The Steps:
1.  **A/B "Hook" Testing:** I would put $200 into the "SOC 2 Cost Calculator" and $200 into the "Readiness Index." I need to see which one has a lower Cost Per Lead (CPL).
2.  **Automated Buyer Routing:** I would set up logic to route leads based on "Intelligence":
    *   Lead has >50 employees? Send to "Premium Buyer A" (Price: $1,200).
    *   Lead has <20 employees? Send to "Boutique Buyer B" (Price: $400).
3.  **Retargeting (The "Ghost" Ad):** Use the remaining $100 to show "Free SOC 2 Readiness PDF" ads to people who visited the site but didn't finish the chat. 
4.  **The "Auditor Portal" Beta:** I would give 3 auditors a login to see "Available Leads" (anonymized) where they can "Bid" to unlock the contact info.

### The "Why":
*   **Why split-testing?** You are buying data to find the "Winning Hook." Once you find it, you pour the $500 into that one path.
*   **Why tiered routing?** Not all leads are equal. Selling a small startup lead for the same price as a mid-market lead is leaving money on the table.
*   **Why retargeting?** In B2B, the first visit rarely converts. You need to "haunt" them until they need the report.

## Scenario 3: The "Ghost" Strategy ($0 Budget - Pure SEO/Tech)
**Objective:** Leverage the "Immense Tech" (AI + Next.js + Programmatic) to build a long-term moat.

### The Steps:
1.  **Programmatic SEO (The 1,000-Page Strategy):** Use AI to generate 1,000 pages for every permutation of: "SOC 2 for [Niche] in [Industry]." Example: "SOC 2 Compliance for AI Startups using AWS."
2.  **The "Comparison" Engine:** Build deep-dive comparison pages between every competitor (Drata vs Vanta, Vanta vs Secureframe, etc.). 
3.  **Automated Internal Linking:** Use the AI to scan every blog post and automatically insert links to the "Readiness Calculator" whenever a high-intent keyword is mentioned.
4.  **The "Free Tool" Backlink Strategy:** I would release the "ISO 42001 (AI) Calculator" on Product Hunt and LinkedIn. This niche is exploding and has zero competition.

### The "Why":
*   **Why Programmatic?** You can't out-write Vanta's blog team. You *can* out-code them by creating 1,000 high-utility utility pages while they write 5 long-form articles.
*   **Why Comparison pages?** These are the "Highest Intent" keywords in the industry. People searching for "Drata vs Vanta" are 90% through the buying cycle. You catch them at the finish line.
*   **Why the AI Calculator?** Being "First to Market" on new frameworks (AI Compliance) earns you authority links that would otherwise cost thousands of dollars.

## Final Philosophy: "Selling the Map, Not the Destination"
The "Gap" is the space between a company realizing they need a SOC 2 and actually buying a platform.
*   **Platforms** (Vanta/Drata) sell the **Destination** (The Audit).
*   **RiscLens** sells the **Map** (The Readiness).
*   **The Logic:** Maps are cheaper to build, faster to update, and every traveler needs one before they pick their vehicle.
