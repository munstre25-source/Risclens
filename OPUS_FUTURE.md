### 6.1 Immediate Priorities (Q1 2026)

1. **Activate Lead Sales**: Close 2-3 buyer contracts at $300-$500/lead

| First $10K Month | March 2026 | 25+ leads sold |
| First $50K Month | August 2026 | Buyer network established |

## Part 7: Proprietary Technical Moats (The "Secret Sauce")

Beyond standard lead generation, RiscLens contains several "invisible" assets that significantly increase its defensibility and acquisition value:

### 7.1 Automated Market Intelligence Engine
The infrastructure in `app/api/admin/intelligence` is an automated data ingestion pipeline. It doesn't just store data; it actively "extracts," "fixes," and "seeds" market intelligence from the auditor ecosystem. 
- **Value**: This eliminates the need for a research team to manually track competitor pricing or auditor changes.

### 7.2 OODA-Based Decision Framework
The integration of an OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop in `app/admin/ooda` represents a sophisticated "Admin AI."
- **Value**: As the platform scales to thousands of leads, this engine provides automated suggestions for lead matching and pricing optimization, making the business manageable by a single operator even at $10M+ revenue.

### 7.3 Multi-Framework Cross-Walking
Proprietary logic for mapping SOC 2 controls to ISO 27001, HIPAA, and GDPR.
- **Value**: Increases the "stickiness" of the platform for leads who need a long-term compliance roadmap, significantly increasing the referral value to auditors.

---

## Part 8: Strategic Scaling Roadmap

### 8.1 Data Moat Expansion (Year 1-2)
- **Strategy**: Use the extraction engine to map 500+ audit firms globally.
- **Goal**: Create the world's most comprehensive database of real-world compliance pricing.

### 8.2 Operational Automation (Year 2-3)
- **Strategy**: Transition from manual lead sales to a fully automated "Lead Auction" model via the Auditor Portal.
- **Goal**: Zero-touch revenue generation.

---

## Conclusion

RiscLens is a high-potential, capital-efficient business positioned at the intersection of two massive tailwinds: (1) the explosion in compliance requirements for B2B software companies, and (2) the increasing sophistication of programmatic SEO and AI-driven lead qualification.

**Revised Pre-Revenue Valuation**: $250,000 - $400,000

**12-Month Revenue Potential**: $560,000 - $900,000

**5-Year Exit Potential**: $150M - $230M (Base Case)

The business requires minimal capital to operate and can generate meaningful cash flow within 90 days of active commercialization. The primary constraint is not technology or product—it is sales activation and buyer network development.
