**Proprietary & Confidential - Prepared for Raphael Ngare Momanyi**
**Date: January 9, 2026**

## 1. Executive Summary
RiscLens is a high-intent lead generation engine for the $15B+ cybersecurity compliance market. Unlike generic content sites, RiscLens captures users at the peak of their "buy cycle" using interactive calculators (SOC 2, ISO 27001, Pentest). 

The primary monetization vehicle is **Lead Arbitrage**: capturing a high-intent user for a cost (CAC) and selling the qualified intent (Lead) to a CPA firm or Security Vendor for a premium.

## 2. Revenue Streams (Via What Means)

### A. Lead Sales (Primary)
*   **Mechanism**: Selling "High Score" leads (Score 5-10) to vetted CPA firms and security auditors.
*   **Unit Price**: $250 – $1,200 per lead (depending on company size and audit urgency).
*   **Target Margin**: 70-85% (assuming organic/low-cost acquisition).

### B. Auditor Introductions (Referral Fees)
*   **Mechanism**: Direct referral to a partner firm where RiscLens takes a success fee (10-15% of the contract value).
*   **Value**: Average SOC 2 Audit contract is $15k–$40k. Referral fee: $1,500 – $6,000 per closed deal.

### C. Pentest Scoping & Referral
*   **Mechanism**: Selling leads specifically for Penetration Testing (often a prerequisite for SOC 2).
*   **Unit Price**: $150 – $400 per lead or $1,000+ referral fee.

### D. Verified Directory Listings (Recurring)
*   **Mechanism**: Auditors and Pentest firms pay a monthly "SaaS" fee ($500/mo) for prioritized placement in the RiscLens Auditor Directory.

## 5. Risk Analysis & Unit Economics (Comprehensive & No-Hype)

### The "Realistic" Math:
*   **Conversion Rate**: 2.5% (Site Visitor -> Calculator Completion).
*   **Qualification Rate**: 40% (Calculator Completion -> High-Score Lead).
*   **Yield**: 10 High-Score Leads per 1,000 visitors.
*   **Revenue per 1k Visitors**: 10 leads * $500/avg = **$5,000 RPM (Revenue per Mille)**.

### Potential Blockers:
1.  **Traffic Volatility**: Reliance on Google Search is high risk. **Mitigation**: Build the LinkedIn OODA loop (active in codebase) to drive direct intent.
2.  **Lead Quality**: If leads are "tire kickers," buyers will churn. **Mitigation**: The built-in Scoring logic (+ enrichment) filters low-value leads automatically.
3.  **Partner Churn**: CPA firms are slow to respond. **Mitigation**: Automate lead delivery via the `new-lead` webhook to ensure instant follow-up.

## 6. Strategic Conclusion
RiscLens is not a "get rich quick" site. It is a **B2B Intelligence Asset**. By owning the "Cost Calculator" and "Readiness Index" for SOC 2, you own the top of the sales funnel for a multi-billion dollar industry. 

**Maximum Value**: The platform is most valuable when it operates as an "Auditor Matching Service," where the trust established by the RiscLens brand allows for premium referral fees that far exceed simple "pay-per-lead" models.
