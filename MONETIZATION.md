## 1. Executive Summary
RiscLens is a high-intent lead generation engine for the $15B+ cybersecurity compliance market. Unlike generic content sites, RiscLens captures users at the peak of their "buy cycle" using interactive calculators (SOC 2, ISO 27001, Pentest) and the **PPC Chat (Pay-Per-Conversation)** engine.

The primary monetization vehicle is **Lead Arbitrage**: capturing high-intent users and selling the qualified intent to CPA firms or Security Vendors for a premium.

## 2. Revenue Streams

### A. Lead Sales (Primary)
*   **Mechanism**: Selling "High Intent" leads to vetted CPA firms and auditors.
*   **Unit Price**: $250 – $1,200 per lead (depending on company size and urgency).
*   **PPC Chat Boost**: The Copilot increases conversion rates by 2-3x compared to static forms, significantly lowering the effective Cost Per Acquisition (CAC).

### B. Auditor Introductions (Referral Fees)
*   **Mechanism**: Direct referral to a partner firm for a success fee (10-15% of the contract value).
*   **Value**: Average SOC 2 Audit contract is $15k–$40k. Referral fee: $1,500 – $6,000 per closed deal.

### C. Pentest Scoping & Referral
*   **Mechanism**: Selling leads specifically for Penetration Testing (mandatory for SOC 2 Type II).
*   **Unit Price**: $150 – $400 per lead or $1,000+ referral fee.

### D. Verified Directory Listings
*   **Mechanism**: Firms pay a monthly "SaaS" fee ($500/mo) for prioritized placement in the RiscLens Directory.

## 3. The PPC Chat Engine (Pay-Per-Conversation)
RiscLens uses a unique "Pay-Per-Conversation" model to maximize the value of expensive B2B traffic.
- **Micro-Qualification**: AI extracts industry, employee count, and timeline during chat.
- **Pattern Interrupt**: At Turn 3, the AI offers the "15-Page Readiness Report" as the ultimate lead magnet.
- **Lead Enrichment**: Chat history is appended to the lead record, providing auditors with "Conversation Intelligence" that justifies a 20-30% higher lead price.
